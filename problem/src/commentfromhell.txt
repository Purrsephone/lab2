**FETCH**

**DECODE**

**EXECUTE**

**MEMORY**
read and write operations take effect immediately
same functions 
    uint32_t mem_read_32(uint64_t address);
    void mem_write_32(uint64_t address, uint32_t value);

Register File: assume combinational read (i.e., output of the read data port is a combinational
function of the RF contents and the corresponding read select port) and synchronous write (i.e., the selected
register is updated on the positive edge clock transition when write enable is asserted).

**REGISTER WRITEBACK**

**MISC**
PC is the address of the instruction following FETCH
PC should be HLT + 8 at the end of sim (stop advnacing PC when HLT is in decode)
when HLT - fininsh everything else before termination
